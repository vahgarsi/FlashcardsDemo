# What are Speech Language Disorders ?

Speech-language disorders, often referred to as communication disorders, encompass a range of conditions that affect an individual's ability to communicate effectively. These disorders can manifest in various ways and may impact speech, language, or both. Speech-language disorders can affect people of all ages, from children to adults. Here's an overview of the two primary categories within speech-language disorders:

## Speech Disorders:

Speech disorders involve difficulties with the physical production of sounds used in spoken language. There are several types of speech disorders:

1. Articulation Disorders: These involve difficulties in pronouncing sounds correctly. For example, a person might substitute one sound for another (e.g., saying "wabbit" instead of "rabbit") or omit sounds from words (e.g., saying "bu" for "bus").

2. Phonological Disorders: These are related to the patterns of sound errors a person makes. A person with a phonological disorder may consistently use incorrect sound patterns.

3. Fluency Disorders: These disorders affect the flow of speech. Stuttering is a well-known fluency disorder, characterized by disruptions in the rhythm and flow of speech.

4. Voice Disorders: Voice disorders involve problems with the vocal cords or the way the voice is used. They can result in hoarseness, pitch problems, or a strained or breathy voice.

## Language Disorders

Language disorders affect a person's ability to understand and/or use language effectively. There are two main types of language disorders:

1. Receptive Language Disorders: Individuals with receptive language disorders have difficulty understanding spoken or written language. They may struggle to follow directions, answer questions, or comprehend stories or conversations.

2. Expressive Language Disorders: Expressive language disorders involve difficulties in using words and sentences to express thoughts, ideas, or needs. People with expressive language disorders may have a limited vocabulary, trouble forming sentences, or difficulty organizing their thoughts coherently.
